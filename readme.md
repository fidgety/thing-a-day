#do one thing a day, for a while

usual `npm i`, then `webpack` to compile the bundles

run tests with `npm test`

So far...

###Day 1
* Added webpack
* First react component
* Added a Google map

###Day 2
* Snap to route when clicking map, added a standard marker to show location
 
###Day 3
* Created a sad custom map marker

###Day 4
* Created Google maps custom overlay util
* Created a icon font for map marker using icomoon
 
###Day 5
* Used reflux to create a waypoint store, this makes each element's responsability clearer

###Day 6
* Created a marker react component, all rendering is custom
* Introduced an elevations lookup with second store. This means one store's update's trigger a second store. This may be bad
